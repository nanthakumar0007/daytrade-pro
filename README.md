## 🎯 How It Works

### **TIME-BASED STRATEGY SELECTION**

#### 1️⃣ **BEFORE 8 AM CST - Intraday Recommendation**
- Runs at market open
- Scans for high-momentum stocks with:
  - **Volume Shock:** 150%+ of 10-day average (indicates breakout)
  - **RSI 45-65:** Not overbought/oversold, room to run
  - **Volatility:** True Range confirms price movement potential
- **Goal:** Buy at open, sell for +$1 profit during the day
- **Risk:** -$0.50 max loss (2:1 RRR)

#### 2️⃣ **11 AM CST - END-OF-DAY SWING**
- For end-of-day swing trades
- Buy at market close or last hour
- Hold overnight, sell next morning at opening gap
- **Goal:** Capture overnight momentum or gap-up reversal

#### 3️⃣ **SAME-DAY OPTIONS**
- 0 DTE (zero days to expiration) options
- Buy call if RSI < 45 (oversold reversal expected)
- Buy put if RSI > 65 (overbought pullback expected)
- Sell same day for quick profit
- **⚠️ EXTREME RISK:** Can lose 100% of premium paid

#### 4️⃣ **FRIDAY WEEKLY OPTIONS**
- Only available on Fridays
- Buy near-ATM calls/puts
- Hold through weekend (MASSIVE gap risk)
- Sell Monday morning at open
- **Expected return:** $0.50-$3.00 profit or 50-150%
- **⚠️ EXTREME RISK:** Weekend gaps can wipe out position

## 💰 Position Sizing

All calculations respect **$35 max capital**:

```
Risk per trade = $0.50 (ensures 2:1 RRR with $1 profit target)
Shares = (35 × 0.95) / Entry Price
Stop Loss = Entry - (True Range × 1.5)
Take Profit = Entry + (True Range × 3)
```

**Example:**
- Stock: AAPL at $25.00
- Shares: 1 share (uses ~$25 capital)
- Stop Loss: $24.50
- Take Profit: $26.50
- Profit: +$1.50 (meets $1 minimum)
- Risk: -$0.50 (2:1 ratio)

---

## 📊 Trading Log

All recommendations are automatically saved to `trades_history.json` in the same folder:

- **Entry price**

- **Shares and capital used**
- **Timestamp and strategy type**
- **Performance metrics**

View in the **History tab** to track:

---

## ⚙️ Technical Indicators

### **RSI (Relative Strength Index, 14-period)**
- **0-30:** Oversold (potential reversal buy)
- **30-70:** Neutral (no extreme condition)
- **70-100:** Overbought (potential reversal sell)
- **Strategy uses:** 45-65 (active momentum, not exhausted)

### **Volume Shock**
- **Current volume / 10-day average**
- **Threshold:** > 1.5x (150%)
- **Meaning:** Unusual activity = volatility/breakout likely

### **True Range (ATR component)**
- **Measures volatility:** High TR = big price swings
- **Used for:** Position sizing and profit target calculation
- **Benefit:** Ensures $1 profit is achievable in current conditions

---

## 🛠️ Customization

### **Change Starting Capital:**
Edit line in code:
```python
# Change from $35 to your amount
position_size = risk_amount / (true_range / current_price)
```

### **Change Profit Target:**
Edit to any amount (currently $1.00):
```python
risk_amount = 0.50  # Adjust based on new profit target
```

### **Add More Stocks:**
Edit the watchlist (currently top 30 most liquid):
```python
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', ...] # Add/remove tickers
```

### **Change Time Thresholds:**
```python
if hour < 8:  # Change 8 to 7 or 9 as desired
if hour >= 11:  # Change 11 to 12 or 10 as desired
```

## 📚 Understanding the Recommendations

### **Why These Filters?**

**Volume Shock (150%+):**
- High volume = institutional/retail interest
- Confirms volatility is real, not noise
- Increases probability of breakout

**RSI 45-65:**
- Avoids oversold (risky reversal trade)
- Avoids overbought (avoid late entries)
- Sweet spot: momentum but not exhausted

**True Range Volatility:**
- Ensures target profit is achievable
- Scales position size to market conditions
- Tight range = smaller positions, wide range = larger positions

**2:1 Risk-to-Reward:**
- You only need 33% win rate to break even
- Built-in margin of safety
- Professional standard

1. **Pre-market prep:** Run app 30 mins before market open
2. **Take profits early:** If you hit 50% of target mid-day, take it
